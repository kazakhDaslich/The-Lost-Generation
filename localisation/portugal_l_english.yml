 # Descriptions
 POR_republican_propaganda_desc:0 "Propaganda is essential to the survival of any stable nation, and Portugal is not an exception to this rule. Under the Ditadura Nacional, propaganda has been utilized to keep the regime alive and prevent the rise of political opposition. Given Salazar’s undeniable charisma and intelligence, the continuation of this propaganda effort is considered necessary to prevent a second coup which this time would succeed and lead to the end of the regime.\n\nHowever, propaganda is not usually the most honest representation of the current situation. The Portuguese “sponsored media” has described the political situation in Portugal as completely stable, while simultaneously constantly claiming that internal traitors are seeking to overthrow the rightful government. The contradictory propaganda has led to widespread distrust in claims by the state and its media, which is undoubtedly harmful to the regime."

 POR_aftermath_of_the_salazar_coup_desc:0 "Four years ago, the ambitious Minister of War António de Oliveira Salazar attempted a coup against Oscar Carmona’s government. While the coup was stopped by the Lisbon Garrison, Salazar was too popular to remove from politics. Thus, a compromise was negotiated in which Salazar would be appointed Minister of Colonies and Governor of Portuguese West Africa in return for pledging his loyalty to the government, which desperately needed legitimacy. This compromise has prevented armed conflict for the time being, but has not reduced the personal struggle between Salazar and Carmona. All in Portugal except the foolish know that this compromise will not remain forever, but it is hard to say who will win out in the resulting struggle."

 POR_overextended_colonization_desc:0 "Portugal capitalised on the collapse of the British and French empires to regain its former status as a colonial empire. However, with massive colonial projects in Africa, suffice to say Portugal’s colonial project is overextended. While the Portuguese has dumped massive amounts of funding into it, not only as a petty project but also to keep Salazar happy as to prevent another coup and as it is recognized as Portugal’s “duty” to prevent these lands from falling to the menace that engulfed France, and nearly took over the British Isles, it still remains underfunded.\n\nPresident Carmona now meets daily with the Overseas Deputy Minister (not wanting to directly meet with his archenemy Salazar), hoping that a solution can be discovered that will not involve bankrupting the Portuguese nation nor abandoning the colonial project. The overextension has also proven to be ammunition for Carmona’s political enemies, such as Antonio Salazar, who boldly accused Carmona of incompetence over the colonial issue and refusing to meet with him because of political bias, and left wing groups who have described the colonial venture as a failed experiment with exploiting foreign labour. Needless to say, Portugal needs a solution soon."

 #Leaders

 POLITICS_OSCAR_CARMONA_DESC:0 "If almost anything had gone different, Oscar Carmona would not be leading Portugal. During the days of the First Republic, Carmona was a staunch republican although he also strongly opposed democracy. In 1926, he participated in a coup against the First Republic that established a new government in Portugal. In this new government, he allied with Antonio Salazar and José Augusto Alves Roçadas. Together, this new triumvirate outmaneuvered its political rivals in the government: Carmona brought his political and military expertise, Salazar brought his charisma and popularity, and Roçadas brought his reputation as a valiant defender of the Portuguese nation during the Great War. However, this triumvirate was doomed to collapse. Tensions had begun to rise between the members of this triumvirate, mainly Carmona and Salazar, and Roçadas was the only man who managed to prevent the two from attacking each other like rabid dogs.\n\nHowever, in September, Roçadas fell ill.\n\nHe died only a few days later, and the last barrier between Carmona and Salazar was gone. Only weeks later, Salazar attempted a coup against President Carmona to take full control of the Portuguese government. The brave defenders of the Belém Palace, the Portuguese Army 4th Division, managed to stop Salazar and imprison him. However, Salazar was a popular figure, and imprisoning him would no doubt be political suicide. Thus, Carmona negotiated a deal with Salazar in which he could lead Portuguese West Africa in return for loyalty to the Portuguese Government. However, this deal may be at the end of its line. Carmona faces many challenges going into the future - but it's not like he isn't experienced.
