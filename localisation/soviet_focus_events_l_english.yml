 soviet_focus.5.d:0 "The Cheka agent stared down at his paper. He had been assigned a lot of odd things, but this one was particularly odd. “Are you sure this is correct?” Vasiliy asked for nearly the third time. “Yes, and it won’t be any less correct next time either.” The man who had responded to him was Pavel Yegorov, a long-time friend of Vasiliy Averin. Together they had led a Bolshevik uprising in Yekaterinoslav, but that was many years ago, and times had changed. Regardless, Vasiliy understood that he would need to begin on his assignment.\n\n Before long, he found the house of the man he was looking for. In his hands he carried a warrant for the man’s arrests, but to arrest the man was not the intention. He knocked on the door, and it was opened quickly. Vasiliy could see a frown on the man’s face as he gazed at Vasiliy’s badge. “Grigori Sokolnikov, I have a warrant for your arrest.”\n\n “For what crimes? Since my dismissal I have spent my days in this house. I have done nothing wrong.” Vasiliy responded. “For crimes against the revolution. That is, the Congress of Soviets has reviewed your dismissal and has decided that they wish for you to return. They want you to speak on economic policy. And if not, you will be arrested.”\n\n The man was obviously surprised. “The Congress wants me? After all this?” He paused. “Oh, very well, this Union is in dire need of reform. I suppose I should take the initiative.”\n\n Vasiliy smiled. “Right this way, Comrade.”"

 soviet_focus.6.t:0 "Report on Gosplan Corruption"
 soviet_focus.6.d:0 "Grigori Sokolnikov had not expected such a drastic turn in events in his life, and yet it had happened. A knock on the door from a Cheka agent had changed the course of his life, and surprisingly, it had been a positive change. Once again he was a revolutionary! And, he would be the pioneer of reform in the Congress. And yet, his hands were shaking as he read through his report one last time. He would be submitting to the Congress a report on corruption in the Gosplan, the central state planning committee in the Soviet Union. He had already made some enemies in the Congress - and he expected that this one would no doubt receive criticism. And yet he did it anyway, because if he was going to try to change things, he might as well go the full length.\n\n Later that day, his report was read aloud to the Congress of Soviets. Discussion could be heard in the Congress. However, one individual stood up - Nikolai Bukharin. “Comrades, I think that the concerns raised by Comrade Sokolnikov are very real concerns, and it follows that they must be seriously considered by the Congress. The Gosplan’s influence has been rapidly spreading and if Sokolnikov’s report is true, the revolution is in danger. In fact, I have already drafted five points to address the issue of Gosplan corruption.” And he began to read..."

 soviet_focus.1.t:0 "Rokossovsky's Plan"
 soviet_focus.1.d:0 "Despite the gloomy weather, Sergey Kamenev did his best to walk briskly into his office. Before he could even sit down to begin working, Comrade Budyonny entered. “Sir, I received a message from the STAVKA. They need you for a meeting later today - the details should be in the message.”\n\n Sergey hated these useless meetings. All this talk about the Red Army, always boiling down to the same point - the Red Army was a disorganized, ineffective force which would never be able to mount a serious defense or invasion should Russia be invaded. He doubted that today’s meeting would be any different. And yet, he would be proven wrong when he entered the meeting room to speak with the STAVKA today.\n\n Today the representatives of the STAVKA were more high-ranked officials: Comrade Tukhachevsky, Comrade Frunze, and Comrade Rokossovsky. Rokossovsky looked like he was barely containing excitement - he could see the commander fidgeting with a paper he was holding in his hands. Moments later, Tukhachevsky broke the silence.\n\n “Comrades, today we have a special meeting. Commander Rokossovsky has brought to us a plan for the defense of our great nation.” Tukhachevsky sat down, and Rokossovsky spoke next. “It is clear as day that the Red Army is incapable of defeating enemy forces that may threaten the Revolution we have established here in Russia. We must begin the effort to reorganize our army and prepare it for war, and even draw up invasion plans. We shall modernize the Red Army into an army capable of leading the path into a new age, a communist age. Now, let me present my proposals…”"
