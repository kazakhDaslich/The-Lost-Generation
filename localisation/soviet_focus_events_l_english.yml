 soviet.focus.1:0 "Rokossovsky's Plan"
 soviet.focus.1.d:0 "Despite the gloomy weather, Sergey Kamenev did his best to walk briskly into his office. Before he could even sit down to begin working, Comrade Budyonny entered. “Sir, I received a message from the STAVKA. They need you for a meeting later today - the details should be in the message.”\n\n Sergey hated these useless meetings. All this talk about the Red Army, always boiling down to the same point - the Red Army was a disorganized, ineffective force which would never be able to mount a serious defense or invasion should Russia be invaded. He doubted that today’s meeting would be any different. And yet, he would be proven wrong when he entered the meeting room to speak with the STAVKA today.\n\n Today the representatives of the STAVKA were more high-ranked officials: Comrade Tukhachevsky, Comrade Frunze, and Comrade Rokossovsky. Rokossovsky looked like he was barely containing excitement - he could see the commander fidgeting with a paper he was holding in his hands. Moments later, Tukhachevsky broke the silence.\n\n “Comrades, today we have a special meeting. Commander Rokossovsky has brought to us a plan for the defense of our great nation.” Tukhachevsky sat down, and Rokossovsky spoke next. “It is clear as day that the Red Army is incapable of defeating enemy forces that may threaten the Revolution we have established here in Russia. We must begin the effort to reorganize our army and prepare it for war, and even draw up invasion plans. We shall modernize the Red Army into an army capable of leading the path into a new age, a communist age. Now, let me present my proposals…”"
