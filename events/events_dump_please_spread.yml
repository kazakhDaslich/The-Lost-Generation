austria.1.t:0 "The Austrian Dilemma"
austria.1.d:0 "In July of 1920, Hungarian dissidents rose up against the once-prosperous Austro-Hungarian Empire. The empire would never recover from this perfidious act of betrayal. But it was no secret why the revolt had happened - the failure of Karl I to reform Austria-Hungary into a multiethnic empire, piled on top with corruption in Vienna and food shortages in the Magyar lands made the Second Hungarian Revolution inevitable.\nThe cowardly Karl I abdicated rather than lead the people of Austria, and foreign enemies such as Romania and Serbia seized the opportunity to seize Austrian lands. It was soon that the entire empire had fallen in some way or another, with Croatia independent and the Czechoslovak Legion preparing for decisive action to take power in Prague. But Otto von Habsburg returned to restore glory to the Austrian Empire where his father had failed. As soon as he had consolidated power within the Austrian homeland, he marched north on Prague and established the Kingdom of Bohemia and Moravia, and marched south on Ljubljana and incorporated the lands into Austria.\nOnce again the glorious black and gold flag flew over Vienna, night and day, but all was not well. In the Balkans and Hungary, the Austrian flag did not fly. Not to mention that seeing the empire restored, Karl I had returned to Vienna and demanded the Austrian throne. Needless to say, the traitor was rejected, and thrown out of Austria. But conservative elements of Austrian society, opposed to the essential reforms of Otto von Habsburg, have not hidden their contempt for the emperor and wishes to restore Karl I. Only time will tell if their plans will succeed..."

switzerland.1.t:0 "The State of Switzerland"
switzerland.1.d:0 "While Switzerland was neutral during the Great War, the effects were certainly felt. Switzerland was blockaded by the Entente for the duration of the war, and both the Entente and Central Powers occasionally violated Swiss neutrality to fight within their borders. And the war caused civil conflict too. The German-speaking population of Switzerland supported the Central Powers, while the French and Italian-speaking population supported the Entente.\nAfter the war, Switzerland faced a new threat - the revolution in France. The socialists wanted to spread their revolution across Europe, and Switzerland was an easy target due to its strong political freedoms. After all, Switzerland had always been a refuge for politically controversial figures, such as Vladimir Lenin. Geneva, a French-speaking city, has become a stronghold for the socialists and left-wing parties grow in support every day.\nSwitzerland will need to consider its position in the world if it wishes to stay “armed and neutral” in the coming years. But this is becoming harder and harder to do as political debates dominate Switzerland."

bohemia.1.t:0 "The State of Bohemia-Moravia"
bohemia.1.d:0 "Following the collapse of Austria-Hungary, the Kingdom of Bohemia was abolished and the Czechoslovak Legion seized control of the nation and declared the Czechoslovak Republic. This republic, however, was short-lived as Otto von Habsburg liberated Bohemia-Moravia and returned it as a loyal state of the Austrian Empire. With order restored, Bohemia-Moravia could consider its own problems.\nWhile Bohemia-Moravia is of course loyal to the empire, supporters of the Czechoslovak Legion have gained even more support in recent years and constitute a significant threat to the empire. The Social Democrats had been gaining support, but faced a major setback when the party split over an official position on the revolution in France. Nevertheless, it seems to have recovered and now constitutes an influential force in Bohemian politics.\nWith nationalism on the rise, the loyal Kingdom must choose its path forward. Shall it continue to remain loyal to the empire? Or is the empire dead - and is it time for Czechoslovakia to be independent? And what should Bohemia make of the revolutionary ideas spreading throughout Europe?"

ostgalizien.1.t:0 "The State of Königreich Ostgalizien"
ostgalizien.1.d:0 "Following the collapse of Austria-Hungary, loyalists in Galicia formed the Königreich Ostgalizien. To our delight, the Austrian Empire was restored by Otto von Habsburg, and Ostgalizien was once again connected to the Austrian heartland after Otto’s March on Prague which established the Kingdom of Bohemia and Moravia.\nAnd while much of the Galician population remains supportive of the Austrian Empire, a minority opposing Austrian rule has become increasingly vocal, and hence has gained more attention than perhaps it deserved. This group is split between the pro-Ukrainian and pro-Polish sides, but what they can agree on is that they wish for the death of the Austrian Empire and the collapse of the Königreich Ostgalizien. It remains unclear whether Ostgalizien will stay loyal to the Austrian crown, or make its own future independent from the dictates of Vienna."

egypt.1.t:0 "The State of Egypt"
egypt.1.d:0 "During the Great War, Egypt was a battleground between the British and the Ottomans, and at the end of the Great War the Sinai Peninsula became a joint administration between the British and the Ottomans. But the Ottoman Empire could not remain for much longer, as it was a dying empire. Egypt allied with the Arabs and Persians in the Great Arabian War, which led to the death of the Ottoman Empire and the partition of Arabia.\nHowever, conflicts immediately arose after the war ended, as Persia claimed lands in Hashemite Iraq which caused tension with the Arabs. These tensions may erupt into a Second Great Arabian War. If they do, Egypt will need to choose its path.\nOn the other hand, Egypt has not avoided the internal politics presently engulfing all countries, as debates erupt about the role of the Egyptian monarchy and Egyptian identity. Egypt will need to solve these debates if it is to move forward as a united nation."

qing.1.t:0 "The Restorationist Government"
qing.1.d:0 "During the Xinhai Revolution, the Qing dynasty was overthrown by violent rebels. There was little hope for the Qing dynasty when even its most loyal official, Yuan Shikai, had betrayed it. And yet, against all odds, Zhang Xun restored the empire for the people of China. However, when republican filth ended the Manchu Restoration, Zhang Xun and Puyi were forced to retreat south to Yunnan, where the have remained until today.\nNow China is fractured. The Five Provinces, the home of the last beacons of Qing restorationism, is surrounded by enemies. To its west stand the Tibetan traitors, who defeated the Restorationist Government and stole from us Chamdo Province. To its east lie the Six Provinces, home of the Hongxian Emperor, who betrayed Qing China and declared himself emperor of China. Can the Restorationists unite China, even with so many enemies standing in its way?"

japan.1.t:0 "The State of Japan"
japan.1.d:0 "During the Great War, Japan supported the Entente and seized German colonies in Asia, decisively defeating the Germans in the Siege of Tsingtao, and in the naval battles of the Pacific. Although the war ended in stalemate in 1919, the Germans soon found themselves running out of money, and sold Japan the colonies that had been occupied during the Great War. In the aftermath of the war, the situation in Japan is complicated by political matters at home and abroad. Internally, the reformist liberals in Minseitō have gained popularity, and Osachi Hamaguchi stands poised to win the upcoming election in 1930.\nAnd while reformists gain ground in the electoral sphere, most political power in Japan is in the army and in the imperial palace in Tokyo. In the army, ultranationalists and proponents of a Japanese Shogunate are gaining ground, and in the emperor’s palace, Hirohito is torn between his personal agenda of exerting his own power and the demands of the army, navy, and Parliament.\nOn the international stage, Japan’s occupation of Korea has been criticized by the League of Nations, which most regard as a powerless institution with no authority over the decisions of the Empire of Japan, and the occupation of Taiwan has led to conflict with the various claimants of the title of ‘China’. China has always been an enemy of Japan, but one which has outpaced Japan. Since the Meiji Restoration, however, this has changed. And after the collapse of the unified Chinese nation after the fall of the Empire of China, it seems that perhaps now is the time for Japan to strike west to the land where the sun sets, for otherwise it may become too late. However, it is unclear who is the enemy and friend of Japan, and some believe that it may be to Japan’s advantage to choose a side in the internal conflict of China. However, which side precisely Japan should take remains unclear.\nAs for the volatile situation in Russia, some have suggested that Japan intervene to promote its own interests in Siberia, as taking control over Vladivostok could both contain the communist menace in the Far Eastern Soviet Republic while raising Japan’s reputation amongst the peace-obsessed diplomats in Geneva.\nAnother important region to Japan is the Pacific, where the red sun must dominate in order to succeed as a true Asian power. The main rival of Japan in this region is the Americans, who have previously remained in a state of neutrality and isolation (similar to the state of Japan before the Americans ended Japanese isolationism), but now appear to be expanding their army and navy and gearing up for conflict. It seems that even to the neutral countries, it is known that the next few years will not be easy for any nation.\nSo Japan has much to busy itself with, from the affairs of the emperor in Tokyo to the interests of the army and navy and Parliament, and international affairs including challenges by the League of Nations and the possibility of interventions in China and Russia. But the red sun is rising, and it shall continue to rise until it stands unmistakable in the sky."

japan.2.t:0 "The Assassination of Osachi Hamaguchi"
japan.2.d:0 "Japan’s liberal reformist Prime Minister, Osachi Hamaguchi, was assassinated today by ultranationalist Tomeo Sagoya while inside Tokyo Station. This comes after a significant drop in his popularity and a rise of nationalist groups such as Aikokusha, the group which Tomeo Sagoya himself belonged to.\nThe event has been met by reactions of shock and surprise amongst the people of Japan, but the Prime Minister’s assassination could help liberal groups regain their popularity in Japan if they are able to appoint a more popular leader. Emperor Hirohito has not made any statement on the Prime Minister’s assassination and some accuse him of fostering nationalist tendencies and refusing to crack down on ultranationalist groups in Japan. However, the events in Tokyo Station today may force the Emperor’s hand."

chile.1.t:0 "The State of Chile"
chile.1.d:0 "In 1927, Carlos Ibáñez del Campo became President of Chile. He was unpopular amongst the people of Chile due to his undemocratic policies and usage of rule by decree. After the revolution in France, the Chilean Socialist Party had been founded by Carlos Dávila and his supporters. This party gained support as the Chilean government failed, and in 1928 a general strike was declared by the Socialist Party. This created an unstable situation in Chile and caused the return of Arturo Alessandri in October. He took control of the Chilean government, but resigned as he was unable to put an end to the strikes.\nThe final blow to the Chilean government came in the form of a declaration by military officer Arturo Puga, who declared support for the strikes. A popular military officer, this led the military to support the Chilean Socialist Party and when Bartolomé Blanche ordered the army to crush the strikes, which had turned into an insurrection, they refused and instead joined the revolutionaries.\nThe Socialist Republic of Chile was declared by Dávila, and immediately Chile was in a dangerous position. All of Chile’s neighbors became hostile towards the new Socialist Republic, concerned that the events in Chile could spread into their own country. However, Chile managed to avoid war.\nThe new Chile faces many threats, and also hopes to expand its revolutionary ideas across South America. It also must make crucial decisions about the future of the Socialist Republic, and consider the potential of striking an alliance with the Bolivarians north in Venezuela."
